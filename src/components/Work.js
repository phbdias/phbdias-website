          Welcome aboard! My name is Paulo Dias and I'm on a mission to
          establish Web3 as the new internet standard. I came from the Azores,
          famously known as the Land of Happy Cows. In my spare time, I'm into
          sports, especially football â€” I'm a huge Benfica fan. You might also
          catch me at the gym, running outdoors, or mountain surfing.
